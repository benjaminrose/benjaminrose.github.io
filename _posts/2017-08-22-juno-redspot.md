NASA's [Juno][juno] spacecraft has a camera called [JunoCam][junocam]. It's main purpose it to take pictures of Jupiter up-close and personal for the whole world to see. It recently [took images] of the [Great Red Spot][grs].

The Great Red Spot has inspired and perplexed people ever since we first saw it. Juno, with its eight science instruments, is now providing us with the most information we have ever had on this phenomenon. Hopefully soon we will hear what scientist have newly discovered about this strange extraterrestrial storm.

If this excites you, Juno invites the public to participate in the Juno mission. You can find out more on their [website][junocam].
