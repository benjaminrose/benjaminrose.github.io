Last night my view of the world changed. I thought our nation was on the precipice of saying no to xenophobia and degrading "locker room talk." I thought we would come together and support those who feel marginalized by main stream society. I felt like our nation would truly, unitedly, take care of the widows, orphans, and the aliens living among us.

My faith is one built on a relationship with a God who died for me and loved me when I was his enemy. From this love, I am drawn to the commands of compassion for the poor and social outcasts. I thought I lived in a nation where these were also priorities. I have been proven wrong. But that does not change my resolve. I will continue to care for and protect those society tries to throw out. I will listen and empathize with all who feel unheard. I will do what I can to amplify the voices and stories of those who feel marginalized and voiceless.

I take hope in the fact that God promised to bless Abraham, his descendants and the whole world no matter what. This blessing is not one of money, power or privilege, but one of restoring love. This restoration is what I am fighting for today and forever more.

Remember, love has already won on that dark night when the curtain was torn in two.
