This is a draft, how do I do drafts in Pelican?

So today was no good. It started last night when at 10:30 we realized we needed some groceries for dinner the next day. Now we were hosting so there was no way to change the meal plan, or even go out. We needed to make it to the grocery store before 6:30. We only have one car so this means some interesting scheduling In this case, the schedule was for me to go to the grocery store before my wife needed to go to work. That was the monkey wrench in the start of my day.

There was also the issue that my phone got stuck restarting. So I did all the normal trouble shooting, starting with the simple stuff last night, the more complicated stuff this morning, and attempting to wipe the phone once I got to work. Nothing worked. This means my no good horrible rotten day was a day where I would not have my phone. So no always on communication with my wife (remember we have a party we are planning). Also no Internet connection to get a bus schedule ('cause I have no personal transportation currently).

When I was at work. My slow computer became slower. I knew I was coming to a point where it needed a few applications closed and a reboot. I started that process, but sadly a bit late. This computer was slower then malassus. After a restart, it was still having major issues. It just did not work today. It is Friday after all.

By lunch time. I had only read through my emails and the arXiv. And at this point my iPad was also acting strangely with crashing apps and freezing completely once.

A few other things: did it fax? Missed the bus to work. Missed the bus to the Apple Store. a wake from sleep on my computer made it act like a restart.

Why am I writing this? Because with this chaos I want to share what I was able to get done, both directly and indirectly.

I was able to finish the background section of a presentation, with help from colleagues. I helped funding committee. I resisted the desire to buy a soda (double issue of calories and cost). I read the arXiv. I sent a vitally important fax (I think). I got my phone de-"bricked" at the Apple Store, without much wait. I made it home on time. I went to the grocery store. I ate lunch. I went to a group meeting and discussed plans for future simple papers (papers equal jobs!). I stayed hydrated. I laughed.
