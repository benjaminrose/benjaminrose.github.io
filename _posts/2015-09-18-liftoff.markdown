[Liftoff](http://www.relay.fm/liftoff) is a podcast about space where you don't need to be a rocket scientist to listen. It has currently released 3 episodes[^1], and they plan on releasing it fortnightly. I highly recommend it as an easy way to learn a little bit about space.

[^1]: or 4 if you count their 0th episode
