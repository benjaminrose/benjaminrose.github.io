I have a [therapy dog][td], his name is Chance. He mostly visits at the local hospital. You can occasionally spot him at the library reading with kids, or on a university campus around exam time.

Serving the community with my dog is very rewarding and adds an interesting perspective on life. I want to share some of that here. So along with my tech and astronomy posts, I will be sprinkling in bits and pieces about my life with a therapy dog.
