summary: 
---

Apple added a few non-standard interaction between [SSH Agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-agent) and there own [Keychain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_(software)). This gave a great default of strong [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) with the convenience of not needing to enter a password all the time. But with [macOS Sierra (10.12) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Sierra) the defaults changed[^defualts]. It took some time for people to figure out what was happening, but finally after 7 months, Bart Busschots [explains how to reset the defaults](https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/2017/05/25/taming-the-terminal-part-37-of-n-ssh-agent/) and regain the old balance of security and convenience. 

For more information on SSH, I recommend the Bart's Taming the Terminal [parts 29 through 33](https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/2015/02/14/taming-the-terminal-part-29-of-n-intro-to-ssh/).

[^defaults]: The previous defaults are explained well in [Taming the Terminal part 30](https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/2015/03/29/taming-the-terminal-part-30-of-n-sshing-more-securely/).
