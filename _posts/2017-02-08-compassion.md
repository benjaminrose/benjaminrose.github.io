Many people set goals for the year. If you do this near January 1st it's called a New Years resolution. For the next 12 months, I am focusing on the word "compassion." 

Merriam-Webster defines it as ["sympathetic consciousness of others' distress together with a desire to alleviate it"][mw]. Wikipedia takes it further, adding that ["compassion is often given a property of 'depth,' 'vigour,'' or 'passion.'"][wiki] and that "The etymology of 'compassion' is Latin, meaning 'co-suffering.'' More involved than simple empathy, compassion commonly gives rise to an active desire to alleviate another's suffering."

This is my desire, to use my passion to advocate and actively alleviate some of the suffering I see in the world. This will cost me time, money, and more. It will be hard to be a co-sufferer while I have my own suffering. My plan is unknown, but the desire is here. Lets see where this goes.
