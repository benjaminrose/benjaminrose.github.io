summary: Vera Rubin, an amazing Astrophysicist who's research changed everything about galaxy formation and cosmology, died this week. If you study something larger than a collection of a few stars (like me), your research is impacted daily by her discoveries.

Vera Rubin, an amazing Astrophysicist who's research changed everything about galaxy formation and cosmology, died this week. If you study something larger than a collection of a few stars (like me), your research is impacted daily by her discoveries.

Gizmodo did a [great article](http://gizmodo.com/the-woman-who-convinced-us-that-dark-matter-existed-was-1790518288) about her. Shockingly, her science was amazing even though she had to overcome many terrible things. Imagine working in a place where all your co-workers can go to the bathroom, but you can't. Or your boss wanting to take credit for your work because you have kids. Even with these horrendous obstacles (many still present in my field) she did Nobel Prize-worthy research. This gives me hope.

I must end this with a plea stated best by Katie Mack:
