The are many bias peddled by our society. 

> If you don’t see bias there, try this: when teachers know students’ names, boys do better on math tests. Yet when grading is anonymous, girls do better on math tests. And before a math test, reminding college students of their gender leads girls to perform 43% worse than boys. But if you just call it a problem-solving test, the gender gap in performance disappears.
> 
> Biases affect men too. Women are stereotyped as more empathetic, and they do score higher than men when you test the ability to read other people’s thoughts and feelings. But if you don’t introduce it as an empathy test, the gender gap vanishes.

Here is a great [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/differences-between-men-women-vastly-exaggerated-adam-grant) discussing difference seen between the genders and how they are extrinsic rather then intrinsic.

As an aside, I feel like the comment that "men feel more confident but women are rated as more competent" is true for so much.
