It takes a wide range of skills to be a scientist. Besides my mathematical, coding, and statistical skills, I need to be a good writer and communicator. Like everything, I need to practice my writing and editing skills. So, I will publish a new idea every week. It may be a blog post,Â code documentation, a couple paragraphs of an upcoming paper, or something else. With this repetition, I hope to build both my writing skills and a great editing workflow.
