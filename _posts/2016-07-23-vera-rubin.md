Happy Birthday Vera Rubin! I love Vera Rubin's story. The more I lean the more I am impressed. Today I learned that it was her 88th birthday from the following tweet. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Vera Rubin, who discovered dark matter, turns 88 today. Somebody give her a Nobel already. <a href="https://t.co/2pWxizquwU">https://t.co/2pWxizquwU</a> <a href="https://t.co/4w8rZz8TCm">pic.twitter.com/4w8rZz8TCm</a></p>&mdash; Maria Popova (@brainpicker) <a href="https://twitter.com/brainpicker/status/756828822738235392">July 23, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
