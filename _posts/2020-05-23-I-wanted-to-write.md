This time, I mostly wanted to write because I got a new keyboard today. Beyond that though, I find writing gives me the space to think.

I am an external processor, I think best while speaking. As such, my wife has become an expert at ignoring me. Without that skill, she would be subjected to every single one of my inner thoughts. However, when my brain is overwhelmed, and my thoughts are racing, I can't speak fast enough to keep up. This is where writing finds its power.

Writing is slow and allows for repeated refining, but is still an external process. It allows me to understand my thoughts, but also acts like meditation and slows me down to a manageable pace. And so, tonight I write.
