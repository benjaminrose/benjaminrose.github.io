Many people complain about Apple's new 12" Macbook. You can find terrible reviews all over the place. There are a few [possive](https://overcast.fm/+BMJqgjzJg/37:50) [reviews](https://overcast.fm/+Eh4At_0kY/07:37) that talk about the [statement piece](https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/05/2016-macbook-review/) that this device is, but most of its press is overtly negative.

My [own laptop](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-2-duo-2.4-15-early-2008-penryn-specs.html) was bought in 2008. It has been harvested for pieces for about a year now. This was after I was tired of waiting for the logic board to finally die. I took my upgraded [hybrid hard drive](http://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Gaming-2-5-Inch-Internal-ST1000LM014/dp/B00B99JUBQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1463535213&sr=8-1&keywords=seagate+1tb+sshd) and added it to a machine I got from work, a 2009 MacBook Pro! That machine was big, heavey, and slow. I timed it once, it took about 8 mins for the an application to open! This did not happen all the time, but common enough that I knew it was going to be worth timing it. If the battery gets too low while sleeping, it could be 15 to 30 minutes before I was able to get started working. This machine was painful to use. But as a graduate student with a family, money was tight and there was always something more important then updating my still working laptop. 

Yesterday I finally was able to buy a new computer. I was not able to buy a $2,500 15" power house, but I decided I did not want one anyway. The main pain points I experineced from my computer was not getting all day battiery life at conferenaces, carring the extra weight as I biked to school everyday, reliability, and I/O speed. I was not hurting much for performance. If I was ever doing a task that was CPU bound, I would just run it on the computer cluster at school. Yes I had programs that ran for multiple days, but I would not run those on any laptop! Also, when you don't upgrade for as long as I have, even the slowest new compter screams. This little MacBook is at least twice as fast in every way you can possible caculate it, when comparing to the last computer I was using. And that is the only comparison that matters. 

This decission took a long time to make, but I do not regret my choise in an ultra portable laptop, that still outpreforms my previous device.

Now I don't feel right without saying that the family did recently get a couple year old iMac that I will be using for storage and "heavy" personal commuting like video coversion. I think even without this machine, the portability of the MacBook (or the rumored new 13" MacBook Pro) would have won me over from the powerhouse that is the quad-core 15" Retina MacBook Pro.
