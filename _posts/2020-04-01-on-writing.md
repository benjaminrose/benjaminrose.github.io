Work can take interesting turns.

In my previous [post](http://benjaminrose.github.io/blog/2018/06/14/needing-to-write.html) I discussed my plan to write more. It was well meaning, but not practical. It was born out of my frustration with not budgeting enough time to edit my [dissertation]. Since then I have learned two things: write more and putting words on the page is not the same as writing.

For the last half year or so, I have been focusing on putting in an ever increasing amount of hours writing. As a scientist, I am judged by how I communicate my ideas. This is predominately done via journal article. During this journey, I have learned that writing has three major phases: idea creation & outlining, drafting, and editing. 

This new framework has worked! Scientists usually write about one article per year. Since my last blog post less than two years ago, I have not written just [one][rgb2019] or [two][rdr2020] journal article but [three][rdc2020]. On top of that, I have one more in the editing stage, and two in the drafting stage. That will be six total articles before the end of the year.

[rdr2020]: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...890...60R/abstract
[rdc2020]: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200212382R/abstract

All told, my previous post was an interesting idea that did not work. However, I was since been able to figure out a framework that does work. Now I am writing more and more and seeing the value from each of the three major writing phases.
