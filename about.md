<!-- # About Ben -->

Hello world! You have reached my website. 

I am a PhD candidate studying Physics. I love technology, photography, music, and my family. More details about me will be here as I expand and develop this site. 

# About my Career

I am a graduate student at the [University of Notre Dame][nd-phys] doing research in Astrophysics. I try to understanding [Type Ia supernovae][sn] and use them to understand the [dynamics and age of the universe][obs-cosmology] with my advisor [Peter Garnavich][peter]. More details can be found on my [professional page][brose3], including a copy of my [CV].

# About this Site

This is a static site built with [Jekyll] and hosted on [Github Pages]. These are great free resources. And if you are looking at trying to put a small bit of content on the web and have [tamed the terminal][ttt] then I would highly recommend this system. My word of warning is to start out simple. Your content is just in [markdown] files so it is easy to change the design and layout later.

Because I do this in my spare time as a hobby I use affiliate links for [Amazon] to help offset the opportunity costs. I would also not turn down any [gifts given][square] purely because of your generosity, but please shoot me an [email](mailto:benjamin.rose@me.com) as well so I know it was not sent by accident. Note that there are currently no financial costs associated with running this website[^thanks].
