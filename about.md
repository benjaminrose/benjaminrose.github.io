<!-- # About Ben -->

Hello world! You have reached my website. 

I am a PhD candidate studying Physics. I love technology, photography, music, and my family. More details about me will be here as I expand and develop this site. 

# About my Career

I am a graduate student at the [University of Notre Dame][nd-phys] doing research in Astrophysics. I try to understanding [Type Ia supernovae][sn] and use them to understand the [dynamics of the universe][obs-cosmology] with my advisor [Peter Garnavich][peter]. More details can be found on my [professional page][brose3].
