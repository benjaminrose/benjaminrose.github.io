We investigate SNe Ia and use them to understand the universe, particularly its age, size, and expansion history. It was this research that won the [2011 Nobel Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2011/summary/).

I am a member of the [Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope](https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov) Supernova Science Investigation Team. One of the main goals of the Roman Space Telescope is to make an 10 times improvement in our understanding and characterization of [Dark Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy).
