SNe Ia appear to know information about its host galaxy, specifically how many stars. This is strange. Why would a single star know about the size of its galaxy? 

There are some explanations for these correlations, such as the fact that you are likely an old star if you live in an old galaxy, but we do not have a satisfying answer. My Ph.D. furthered our understanding of these correlations, but there is still work to be done.
