I just learned about python's [`assert`](assert) keyword. This keyword needs to be used in every scientific code base. `assert` is essentially a short hand of:

[assert]: https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement

```python
if not expression: 
    raise AssertionError
```

Science is all about slowly building experimental knowledge on the past through new tests of ideas. Our code should test itself[^1]. When solving problems as a student, teachers always instruct you to check how realistic your answer is when you are done. Like you would never get a plane flying at [11 km/s][escape velocity], nor would a rocket ship go faster then [3 x 10<sup>8</sup> km/s][light]. You just learn limits like these. There sanity checks should be just be apart of our code!

I have spent a lot of time checking my code, printing statements, verifying numbers. Some of my late stage debugging would not have been needed if I had known about and used `assert` statements. 

A practical example is testing that you only changed what you wanted to. I needed to change the pixel scale on an image but keep the built in coordinate system correct. Even thought I went form roughly a 2120x2072 pixel image to a 265x259 pixel image, it still needed to coved the same area on the sky. I needed to `assert` that my World Coordinate System (WCS) was the same in both images in each corner as well as the center. This section of code follows for anyone who needs the python and astropy specifics. 

```python
#get wcs for original data
wOrig = wcs.WCS(header1)
#define pixels to test, not perfect corners, but is divisible by 8!
pixOrig = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 2072], [1060, 1036], [2120, 0], 
                    [2120, 2072]], np.float_)
pix = pixOrig/8
#get world values
worldOrig = wOrig.wcs_pix2world(pixOrig, 1)
world = w.wcs_pix2world(pix, 1)
#throw error if ra or dec of any is off by more then 1e-7, 1"==2.7e-4Ëš
assert np.max(np.abs(worldOrig - world)) < 1e-7
```
