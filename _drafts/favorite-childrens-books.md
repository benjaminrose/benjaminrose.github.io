My son is now 18 months. And in the past year and a half I have read a number of kids books. I wanted to contribute my small portion to the discussion of good children's books. You can read about them here, or click the link to them on Amazon.

## Ten Nine Eight

This is a lovely and simple book. My son gives the little girl in the store "Three kisses . . . " right on cue. He also loves to follow the ***cat and ball and shoes

## Say Hello
''

Carmalita and her dog are so much fun. They make their way to their grandmother's house via their diverse neighborhood. I am sure you will learn at least one new way to say hello from this book and Carmalita's neighborhood. 

## Sesame Street

## Charley the Ranch Dog

no paperback and it looks like a series?

Cookies Week?

Mama do you love me?
