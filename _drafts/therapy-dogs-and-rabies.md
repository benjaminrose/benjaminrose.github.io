And a therapy dog at a hospital you quickly notice the patients there for rabies treatments. After recently being attached by an unknown animal, they don't like the surprise of a dog in the hospital. 

There are a few that are different. Recently one told the staff that they were looking forward to my visit. They petted Chance and had a nice visit. The company with them also enjoyed Chance. Then the nurses handed out some dog treat, as usual, and right on cue, Chance's lab-ervore took over. I always expect it and he is always in control, but he starts darting around trying to find **all** the treats. He wound up getting a bit too close to this patient and I'm sure it triggered some flash backs. 

After a few moments, and a lot of comforting from family/friends, everything was ok. They even went back to petting Chance like before. This was a tricky situation for chance. But with his good behavior and training I can tell you he helped. And I think he helped make sure this person stays an animal lover. and hopeful this whole rabies incident
