Recently I [found out][gh-badge] that I contributed to code that was apart of [NASAâ€™s Ingenuity Helicopter][ingenuity], the first flying object on Mars.

First off, my contribution was minor. It was [14 lines][pr] that documented a limitation of a particular numerical method. Since these are lines of developers, I don't even know if those lines were sent to Mars. In addition, I don't even know if JPL used this [one method][quad]! 

However, this whole thing is cool and shows how tight knit and interdependent science is. I was using a function where an edge case was not documented. So I wrote a few sentences describing the behavior. Since this package is so popular, that people flying on Mars also used that software, and my work is no "on Mars!"
