# Supernova Research Collaboration (SRC)


## Purpose

This is a slack community, found at [https://sn-research.slack.com](https://sn-research.slack.com), to foster communication between individual scientific collaborators working on small, inter-institute projects with a focus on supernova research. Get your sign-up link at the bottom of this page!

This is not a for large projects or groups. We request that you crate your own space, thank you. Large projects like [LSST](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/LSSTDESC/) or [WFIRST](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/site/wfirst) already have their own spaces. Though small working groups from these larger projects are more than welcome, just don't run the whole operation from this space.


## Nomenclature

We have many channels, some are fun (#random), some are "water cooler talk" related to large projects many of us are participating in (#lsst, #wfirst), but most of the channels will be private work focused channels. Here we can discuss the progress of a paper (#paper-*description/cite-key*) or a project that is larger than one paper (#proj-*description*).


## Code of Conduct

We want a place where everyone field safe to be themselves. So we have intuitive code of conduct and a Community Committee to protect and advocate for the typically marginalized.

We write this code of conduct with inspiration (and some direct coping) from the LSST DESC's Professional Conduct Policies ([http://lsstdesc.org/sites/default/files/LSST_DESC_Professional_Conduct.pdf](http://lsstdesc.org/sites/default/files/LSST_DESC_Professional_Conduct.pdf)) and Astopy's Community Code of Conduct ([https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html](https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html)). If there is an incident not covered bellow, we will fall back to the best judgment of the Community Committee.

### The Supernova Research Collaboration Code of Conduct

By joining, we attest that the type of community this space becomes will be created by our collective actions, as such,

* We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment- and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation and/or gender identity, age, disability, physical appearance, lactation or pregnancy, body size, race, nationality, ethnicity, political affiliation, and religion. In particular, sexual language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not appropriate. 
* Verbal, non-verbal or physical harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. Behaviors and language acceptable to one person may not be to another. Members must make every effort to ensure that words and actions communicate respect for others. In particular, sexual harassment is not tolerated in our community, including but not limited to inappropriate verbal and physical conduct, unwelcome sexual advances, and requests for sexual favors.
* We pledge to respect the work (code, papers, or ideas) of others by recognizing acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or acknowledged.
* We pledge to perform research in a well-documented and ethically sound manner. Falsification of data or results, plagiarism, taking credit for others’ work or any other scientific misconduct will not be tolerated. 
* We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and realize that including people with a variety of opinions and backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community. In particular, discussions relating to pros/cons of various technologies, programming languages, career paths, and so on are welcome, but these should be done with respect, taking proactive measure to ensure that all participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely express their opinions.
* We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying particular attention to those new to the community. We pledge to provide respectful criticisms and feedback where appropriate.
* We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider community and to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive to model behaviors that encourage productive debate and disagreement, both within our community and where we are criticized. We will treat those outside our community with the same respect as people within our community.
* We pledge to help the entire community follow this code of conduct, and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of conduct. We will take action when members of our community violate this code such as contacting the Community Committee (all relevant emails or direct messages sent to any member of this group will be treated with the strictest confidence) or talking privately with the person.

This code of conduct applies to all community situations online and offline, in group events or one-to-one interactions.

### Consequences of Misconduct

If you notice any misconduct it can be reported either publicly or privately to the Community Committee. In the case of a private report, the Committee will treat the reporting with the strictest of confidence.

In the case of a formal complaint, the Community Committee will designate two members to hear both sides of the complaint, and if appropriate, consult witnesses. The Committee are responsible for ensuring the timely resolution of any formal complaints. If the complaint is upheld, the Community Committee will have a range of actions at their disposal to remedy the situation, up to and including removal from the SRC. In addition, the Committee reserves the right to remove a member from the SRC without formal investigation based on sanction or censure by the member’s department, institution, or professional society for activity that constitutes a violation of this Code of Conduct or places members at risk. The Community Committee will communicate the outcome of any investigation only to the complainant(s), the respondent(s) and those who they deem need to know.

Retaliation toward a member who pursues any of these options, or toward anyone assisting either in the Ombuds process or in the investigation of a formal complaint, is a violation of this Code.
