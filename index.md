# About this Site

This is a static site built with [Jekyll] and hosted on [Github Pages]. These are great free resources, and if you are looking to put a small bit of content on the web and have [tamed the terminal][ttt] then I would highly recommend this system. My word of warning is to start out simple. Your content is just in [markdown] files so it is easy to change the design and layout later.

Can I link to the [blog](/blog/)?

# About my Work

I try to understanding [Type Ia supernovae][sn] and use them to understand the [dynamics and age of the universe][obs-cosmology]. I do my dream job, one I dreamed about since I was in middle school. I hope that I never forget this privilege and the people who helped me get here.
I received my PhD at the [University of Notre Dame][nd-phys] doing research in Astrophysics with my advisor [Peter Garnavich][peter]. Currently I am at [Space Telescope Science Institute][stsci].
More details can be found on my [professional web page][brose3], including a copy of my [CV].

# A bit more

Because I do this in my spare time as a hobby I occasionally use affiliate links for [Amazon] to help offset the opportunity costs. Note that there are currently no financial costs associated with running this website. Thanks Github for the hosting!
