I am an [Astrophysics](/research) who loves technology, photography, music, and my being with my family. To learn more about me, here is a [blog](blog) of semi-random thoughts.

## About my Work

During the day, I try to understand [Type Ia supernovae][sn] and use them to measure the [age of the universe][obs-cosmology]. I get to do the job I have dreamed about since I was in middle school. I hope to never forget this privilege and all the people who helped me along the way.
For more information about my work, read my [research](/research) page.

## About this Site

This is a static site built with [Jekyll] and hosted on [Github Pages]. These are great free resources, and if you are looking to put a small bit of content on the internet and you have [tamed the terminal][ttt] then I would highly recommend a static site system.
