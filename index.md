<!-- # About Ben -->

I am an [Astrophysicist](/research) who loves biking, technology, music, photography, and my being with my family. To learn more about me personally, check out my [blog](blog) of semi-random thoughts.

## At Work

During the day, I try to make ultra-precise distance measurements across 80 Billion lightyears using [Type Ia supernovae][sn]. I also teach and train the next generation of scientists.
For more information about my work, read my [research](/research) page.

## About this Site

This is a static site built with [Jekyll] and hosted on [Github Pages]. These are great free resources, and if you are looking to put a small bit of content on the internet (and you have [tamed the terminal][ttt]) then I would highly recommend this system.
