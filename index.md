<!-- # About Ben -->

I am an [Astrophysicist](/research) who loves biking, technology, music, photography, and my being with my family. To learn more about me, here is a [blog](blog) of semi-random thoughts.

## At Work

During the day, I try to understand [Type Ia supernovae][sn] and use them to measure, amounts other things, the [age of the universe][obs-cosmology]. I get to do the job I have dreamed about since middle school. I hope to never forget this privilege and all the people who helped me along the way.
For more information about my work, read my [research](/research) page.

## About this Site

This is a static site built with [Jekyll] and hosted on [Github Pages]. These are great free resources, and if you are looking to put a small bit of content on the internet (and you have [tamed the terminal][ttt]) then I would highly recommend this system.
